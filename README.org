** GRAW

Inspired by this event, a group of Garmin (Connect) users challenged themselves by adapting the CRAW course to a "Garmin Race Around the World" (GRAW) challenge - with some tweaks:

- a total of 12 participants max, one per region, which work as a team - each individual ;
- no consideration for the "relay" part - every participant may progress at the same time as others ;
- to be more accessible, and so to not only take account of running activities for instance, challenge is based on number of steps (Garmin challenge feature) - even daily walking (not even registered as proper activity) does count ;
- the total distance of assigned region must be "crossed" in one year and this starting from 2020-11-01 - considering an average conversion of 1 meter for 1 step) ;
- as a limit of Garmin challenges (max duration of 1 month), 12 monthly challenges will be used - with each month end, a new challenge is created and previous progression reported - completion of monthly distance is not required.

List of regions, as stated in CRAW (distances in km - for number of steps: x 1000):

| ## | RÃ©gion | Dist | Dist/m | Dist/j |
|----+--------+------|--------|--------|
| 01 | Latin America | 4009 | 334.08 | 10.98 |
| 02 | Andes | 4948 | 412.33 | 13.56 |

* Concept

Garmin challenge are simple leaderboards.

In order to give more appeal to the challenge, it seems interesting to setup a more visual transcription.

The main idea is to show on a world map, for each region, its complete trace and the corresponding progression of each participant.

To keep it simple, this results in a simple static webpage hosted via GitHub Pages: [[https://midorino.githu.io/graw]].
