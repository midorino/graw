* Versioning

Based on [[https://zach-gollwitzer.medium.com/git-crash-course-a-simple-workflow-for-small-teams-and-startups-c491919c9f77]].

Other possible inspirations:

* Roadmap

** Maintenance Page

Page generated via "Better Error Pages" free service (provided by [[https://www.statuspage.io/][Statuspage]]) but without all scripts.

But still too much bloated IMHO.

*** TODO Better get inspired from [[https://www.atlassian.com/blog/statuspage/maintenance-page-examples]] (especially "Product Hunt" example with Midorino logo for instance).

*** TODO Org-mode TODO syntax seems to not be well supported by GitHub previewier ; better to move "Roadmap" section to specific file (eg: "ROADMAP.org").
