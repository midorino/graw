For development workflow, switch GitHub Pages settings to current working branch ("develop" or "feat-*").

Consider some delay (1-2 minutes) for GitHub to actually commit updates from repository to GitHub Pages.

** [FEAT-AAA] Test of [[https://leafletjs.com/][Leaflet.js]] library.

Check the [[https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/][Quick Start Guide]] examples.

[[https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/example-basic.html][Basic Example]] local test (i.e. open local files from web browser) is successful.

But wonder about the first argument of =L.tileLayer()= call - seems to be an API key - is it freely usable?

Actually, "Leaflet Basic example" description explains this: the "mapbox/streets-v11" tiles from Mapboxâ€™s Static Tiles API are used - and in order to use tiles from Mapbox, an access token must be requested.

*** TODO Request a Mapbox access token: [[https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/]].

But for now, the provided Leaflet access token will be used.
The access token value is simply moved to a variable to ease its future update.

Note that a GET request is made in live version for "https://midorino.github.io/graw/favicon.ico" - unsuccessful. But no element from "index.html" seems to be the source of this request (maybe in the Leaflet CSS or JS?).

*** TODO Investigate further the "favicon" GET request in live version.

** [FEAT-AAB] Leaflet Drawing

Consider [[https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/example-overlays.html]] and [[https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/example-popups.html]] and easily add marker, circle, polygons and popups (attached to figures or standalones).

Examples description explains that use =openOn= instead of =addTo= to handle automatic closing of a previously opened popup when opening a new one which is good for usability. But it seems to be no pratical difference when both are tested.

*** TODO Investigate further the difference between =addTo()= and =openOn()= in Leaflet.

* TODO Better get inspired from [[https://www.atlassian.com/blog/statuspage/maintenance-page-examples]] (especially "Product Hunt" example with Midorino logo for instance).

* TODO Org-mode TODO syntax seems to not be well supported by GitHub previewier ; better to move "Roadmap" section to specific file (eg: "ROADMAP.org").

* Tools to get GPX

- *Google Maps x https://mapstogpx.com/*
- https://maps.openrouteservice.org

* TODO

For Google Maps API, registring a billing account is required, though 200$-worth calls are free ; possibility to configure daily limits to not exceed.

Ref: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/error-messages?utm_source=maps_js&utm_medium=degraded&utm_campaign=billing#api-key-and-billing-errors

Alt: OpenStreetMap API?

Orientation to Leaflet

Best way seems to get global GPX of CRAW to display total routes and add another route for each participant from partial GPX data (with Leaflet GPX plugin: https://github.com/mpetazzoni/leaflet-gpx).

---

How to generate partial progress GPX data from calculate ratio of progress?

---

In addition to the map, progress bars on the side?
