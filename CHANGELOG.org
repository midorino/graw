#+TITLE: GRAW - Changelog
#+DESCRIPTION: All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) - though syntax has been adapted to Org-mode syntax,
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) - well trying actually.

Futhermore, take note that, in general, if a change has no impact on "users", it is leaved out of this file.
For more internal notes, it may be revelant to check the =LOG= files instead (inside =log= repository).
