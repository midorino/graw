* TODO Better get inspired from [[https://www.atlassian.com/blog/statuspage/maintenance-page-examples]] (especially "Product Hunt" example with Midorino logo for instance).

* TODO Org-mode TODO syntax seems to not be well supported by GitHub previewier ; better to move "Roadmap" section to specific file (eg: "ROADMAP.org").
