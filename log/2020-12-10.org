** Add "optimal" data comparison in view

Simple yearly average relative ratio in view - pretty straightforward.

#+BEGIN_SRC json
let diffTimeSinceStart = Math.abs(datetime - new Date(2020,11,01).getTime()); // Here is considered the last update as a reference point (and not "today") ; also, challenge started on 2020-11-01.
let diffDaysSinceStart = Math.ceil(diffTimeSinceStart / (1000 * 3600 * 24));
let distanceActualOptimal = distanceActualTotal / 365 * diffDaysSinceStart;
let rateOptimal = distanceActualOptimal / distanceActualTotal;
