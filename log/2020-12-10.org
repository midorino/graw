** Add "optimal" data comparison in view

Simple yearly average relative ratio in view - pretty straightforward.

#+BEGIN_SRC json
let diffTimeSinceStart = Math.abs(new Date(datetime).getTime() - new Date("2020-11-01").getTime());  // Here is considered the last update as a reference point (and not "today") - also, challenge started on 2020-11-01.
let diffDaysSinceStart = Math.ceil(diffTimeSinceStart / (1000 * 3600 * 24));
let distanceActualOptimal = distanceActualTotal / 365 * diffDaysSinceStart;
let rateOptimal = distanceActualOptimal / distanceActualTotal;
#+END_SRC

** [FEAT-AAL] Street View

Initial consideration: Google Street View.

But API key required and possibly non free (TBC).

Furthermore, use of URL schemes construction without previous requirements against Google's terms of service.
