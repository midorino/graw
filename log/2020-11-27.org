** [FEAT-AAI] Progress display

Update progress marker calculus.
Must not be calculated from number of waypoints.
But (if possible) from total "polygones / lines" length displayed.

- Line drawing = f(complete lines already drawed from GPX).
- Marker position = coordinates of last line point drawed.
