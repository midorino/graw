** [FEAT-AAK] Load most recent JSON data file

Initial idea roadmap:

- List server-side files in folder (=data/graw=)
- For each file, convert file name to date
- Identify most recent JSON data file
- Load data from most recent JSON data (already implemented)
- Upgrade to file naming with date *and time*?
- Code cleaning

NB: data file must be manually feed with *total* sum of steps for each participant from challenge start (2020-11-01).

But JS is client side only - cannnot list files without using server side technology.

Alternative: unique file with all data (one node per export date) (+ archives?).

New JSON structure:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
[
	{
		"datetime": "<DATETIME WITH ISO FORMAT YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ'>",
		"data": [
			{
				"id": 1,
				"region": 1,
				"steps": 12131
			},
			(...)
		]
	},
	(...)
]
#+END_SRC

New roadmap:

- Load unique JSON data file (=data/graw.json=)
- Identify most recent JSON data node (with =datetime= field)
- Transfer most recent data to already implemented process
- Display most recent datetime in view
- Code cleaning
