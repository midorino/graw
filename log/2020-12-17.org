** [2.1.0] Change distance unit from step to meter.

In order to prepare other participants sources incomings (eg: Strava).

Actually, the distance unit already used is the meter (m).

#+SRC_BEGIN js
let distanceActualRecord = record.steps / 1000 * 1000; // Just to remind that 1 step ~ 1 m but also all calculus below are in meters (not km).
#+SRC_END

So, in fact, the main changement to be made is of a naming convention: both variables in the main logic =index.js= and fields in =records.json= data file must be me moved from "steps" to "distance".
A simple search and replace is enough.
