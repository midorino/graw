** World copy jump

If map is dragged oustide initial view, original displayed data do not appear in the new "view".

Map may be initialized with +worldCopyJump+ option enabled ; now, if map is dragged enough (i.e. past "middle"), view rather seamlessly jumps to initial view (and displayed data).

User experience is not perfect though - may be interesting to search further to enhance this.
