For development workflow, switch GitHub Pages settings to current working branch ("develop" or "feat-*").

Consider some delay (1-2 minutes) for GitHub to actually commit updates from repository to GitHub Pages.

** [FEAT-AAA] Test of [[https://leafletjs.com/][Leaflet.js]] library.

Check the [[https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/][Quick Start Guide]] examples.

[[https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/example-basic.html][Basic Example]] local test (i.e. open local files from web browser) is successful.

But wonder about the first argument of =L.tileLayer()= call - seems to be an API key - is it freely usable?

Actually, "Leaflet Basic example" description explains this: the "mapbox/streets-v11" tiles from Mapboxâ€™s Static Tiles API are used - and in order to use tiles from Mapbox, an access token must be requested.

But for now, the provided Leaflet access token will be used.
The access token value is simply moved to a variable to ease its future update.

Note that a GET request is made in live version for "https://midorino.github.io/graw/favicon.ico" - unsuccessful. But no element from "index.html" seems to be the source of this request (maybe in the Leaflet CSS or JS?).

** [FEAT-AAB] Leaflet Drawing

Consider [[https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/example-overlays.html]] and [[https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/example-popups.html]] and easily add marker, circle, polygons and popups (attached to figures or standalones).

Examples description explains that use =openOn= instead of =addTo= to handle automatic closing of a previously opened popup when opening a new one which is good for usability. But it seems to be no pratical difference when both are tested.

** [FEAT-AAC] Leaflet Events

Consider final part of Leaflet "Quick Start Guide" relative to events management - NSTR.
